# vteam-hybrid

**A virtual development team for Claude Code.** One template. A team of specialists that enforces TDD, challenges architecture decisions, and gets smarter the more you use it.

> Claude Code is powerful, but on a real project it drifts. You ask it to implement a feature and it skips tests. You ask for architecture advice and it writes code instead. Reviews are inconsistent. Context evaporates between sessions.
>
> vteam-hybrid fixes this with 18 specialized agents — each with a defined role, clear boundaries, and rules about when they activate. You talk in natural language. The template handles the discipline.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create from template

Click **"Use this template"** on GitHub, or:

```bash
git clone <this-repo> my-project && cd my-project
rm -rf .git && git init && git add -A
git commit -m "chore: initialize from vteam-hybrid template"
```

**Validate:** `ls .claude/agents/` — you should see 19 agent files.

### 2. Open in Claude Code

```bash
claude
```

### 3. Scaffold your stack (optional)

| Command | What it sets up |
|---------|----------------|
| `/scaffold-cli` | Python or Rust CLI tool |
| `/scaffold-web-monorepo` | TypeScript monorepo (Next.js, React) |
| `/scaffold-ai-tool` | Python AI/ML tool (FastAPI, Streamlit) |
| `/scaffold-static-site` | Static site for GitHub Pages |

No scaffold fits? Skip this — the template works with any tech stack.

**Validate:** `ls docs/code-map.md` exists (moved from `docs/scaffolds/`).

### 4. Run discovery

```
/kickoff I want to build <your project description>
```

This is interactive — expect 15-30 minutes across 5 phases. Cam asks about your vision, Pat captures your product philosophy, Dani explores design concepts, Archie proposes architecture (and Wei challenges it), and Grace sets up your project board.

**Validate:** You should have `docs/product-context.md`, at least one ADR in `docs/adrs/`, and issues on your GitHub Projects board.

### 5. Start building

```
/tdd <feature-name>
```

Tara writes failing tests first. Sato makes them pass. Code review runs automatically with three parallel lenses.

**Validate:** A new test file, implementation code, and the issue moved to "In Review."

---

## How It Works

```
You:  I want to build a CLI tool that converts markdown to PDF

Cam:  Let me explore that with you. Who's the target user —
      developers or non-technical users? And what's your priority:
      fidelity to the markdown spec, or speed of conversion?

You:  Developers, and speed matters more than fidelity.

Cam:  Got it. Let me probe a few more things before we commit to
      an approach...
```

After discovery, the system hands off to Tara (failing tests) then Sato (implementation). You stay in control — the agents do the structured work.

**The five core agents** (always available):

| Agent | Role | When they activate |
|-------|------|--------------------|
| **Cam** | Vision and elicitation | When you describe a new idea or vague requirement |
| **Sato** | Implementation | When code needs to be written |
| **Tara** | Testing (TDD) | Before Sato — writes failing tests first |
| **Pat** | Product and priorities | When requirements need defining or priorities need setting |
| **Grace** | Tracking and coordination | When work needs to be organized or status tracked |

**Additional agents** activate when the work demands it — Archie for architecture, Vik for code review, Pierrot for security, Wei for devil's advocacy, Dani for design. You don't need to learn them upfront.

---

## What Makes This Different

- **TDD is enforced**, not suggested. Tara writes failing tests before Sato writes code.
- **Architecture decisions get challenged.** Archie proposes, Wei attacks. Structured debate, not rubber-stamping.
- **Security review is automatic.** Pierrot reviews every PR for vulnerabilities.
- **Context survives between sessions.** Agent-notes in every file mean Claude doesn't start from zero.
- **Sprint lifecycle is managed.** Grace tracks velocity, Pat manages the backlog, `/sprint-boundary` runs retros.

## Sprint Lifecycle

<!-- Text summary for accessibility: Plan (Pat + Grace) -> Architecture gate if needed (Archie + Wei debate) -> TDD cycle (Tara writes tests, Sato implements) -> Code review (Vik + Tara + Pierrot, three lenses) -> Done Gate (15-item checklist) -> repeat or sprint boundary -->
